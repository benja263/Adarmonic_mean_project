# What Russian Trolls Care About During the 2016 U.S. Elections: A Timeline Analysis

# Abstract
It is currently under investigation whether during the 2016 U.S. elections a Russian 'troll factory' released a number of tweets from fraudulent Twitter accounts. These tweets potentially influenced the population of voters by spreading statements. some of which were fake. The aim of this project is to better understand the strategy of the trolls by retrieving the main subjects of these tweets over time and categorizing them according to their targeted social or political group. Quantifing the potential impact of those tweets and providing a link to specific events that were occuring in the United States at the time are the objectives. 

# Research questions

- What types of social groups were targeted
- Frequencies and characteristics of tweets preceding or succeding electoral events, mainly focusing on swing states
- What were the main topics of the fraudulent Twitter accounts over time
- What was the most effective strategy for the trolls (quantified by increases in followers)
- Is there a relation between the activities of trolls related to specific events and results of the elections

# Dataset
The dataset we will use is the IRA tweet dataset. We will supplement it with the final election results in different U.S. states.

The IRA tweet dataset comprises a number of columns, including but not limited to, author ID, author, content (the tweet itself), region, language, date, following and account type. We expect the types of accounts to differ in activity and subject matter depening on the timeframe. We will attempt to correlate this activity to the current events at the time. 

Datasize and format should not be an issue. The decompressed file is less than 1 GB in .csv format. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Read the paper published by the Clemson researchers. 
- Loading and cleaning the data. Processing the tweets to better understand which subjects they incorporate (this includes their hashtags and retrieving the subject of the keywords)
