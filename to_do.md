# Stuff to do

- Take users mentioned and do histogram. Simplify with top most mentioned if needed. Try to do timeline analysis
- Take all swing states. Use dictionary. Extract account categories/topics to see what is being targetted. Timeline
- Analyse likes and hashtags within those tweets to try to link events. Did the Russians amplify the importance for an event?
- See if popular authors close to election time were tweeting about sports/neutral news preivously
- Check that likes correlated with followers
